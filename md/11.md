## Lesson 11: Integrate details page into application

- https://angular.io/tutorial/first-app/first-app-lesson-11



### Conceptual preview of routing

- Each housing location has specific details that should be displayed when a user navigates to the details page for that item. To accomplish this goal, you will need to use route parameters.
- Route parameters enable you to include dynamic information as a part of your route URL. To identify which housing location a user has clicked on you will use the `id` property of the `HousingLocation` type.


### Step 1 - Create a new service for your app

- In lesson 10, you added a second route to `src/app/routes.ts` which includes a special segment that identifies the route parameter, `id`.
```ts
'details/:id'
```

- In this case, `:id` is dynamic and will change based on how the route is requested by the code.

- In `src/app/housing-location/housing-location.component.ts`, add an anchor tag to the section element and include the `routerLink` directive.
```ts
template: `
  <section class="listing">
    <img class="listing-photo" [src]="housingLocation.photo" alt="Exterior photo of {{housingLocation.name}}">
    <h2 class="listing-heading">{{ housingLocation.name }}</h2>
    <p class="listing-location">{{ housingLocation.city}}, {{housingLocation.state }}</p>
    <a [routerLink]="['/details', housingLocation.id]">Learn More</a>
  </section>
`,
```
- The `routerLink` directive enables Angular's router to create dynamic links in the application. The value assigned to the `routerLink` is an array with two entries: the static portion of the path and the dynamic data.
- For the `routerLink` to work in the template, add a file level import of `RouterLink` and `RouterOutlet` from '@angular/router', then update the component imports array to include both `RouterLink` and `RouterOutlet`.


### Step 2 - Get route parameters

- In `src/app/details/details.component.ts` update the template to import the functions, classes and services that you'll need to use in the `DetailsComponent`
```ts
import { Component, inject } from '@angular/core';
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';
import { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';
import { HousingService } from '../housing.service';
import { HousingLocation } from '../housinglocation';
```

- Update the template property of the `@Component` decorator to display the value `housingLocationId`.
```ts
template: `<p>details works! {{ housingLocationId }}</p>`,
```

- Update the body of the `DetailsComponent`.
```ts
export class DetailsComponent {
    route: ActivatedRoute = inject(ActivatedRoute);
    housingLocationId = -1;
    constructor() {
        this.housingLocationId = Number(this.route.snapshot.params['id']);
    }
}
```

- This code gives the `DetailsComponent` access to the `ActivatedRoute` router feature that enables you to have access to the data about the current route. In the constructor, the code converts the id parameter acquired from the route from a string to a number.



### Step 3 - Customize the DetailComponent
- To access the data you will add a call to the `HousingService`.
- **src/app/details/details.component.ts**
```ts
template: `
  <article>
    <img class="listing-photo" [src]="housingLocation?.photo"
      alt="Exterior photo of {{housingLocation?.name}}"/>
    <section class="listing-description">
      <h2 class="listing-heading">{{housingLocation?.name}}</h2>
      <p class="listing-location">{{housingLocation?.city}}, {{housingLocation?.state}}</p>
    </section>
    <section class="listing-features">
      <h2 class="section-heading">About this housing location</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Units available: {{housingLocation?.availableUnits}}</li>
        <li>Does this location have wifi: {{housingLocation?.wifi}}</li>
        <li>Does this location have laundry: {{housingLocation?.laundry}}</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
  </article>
`,
```

- Notice that the `housingLocation` properties are being accessed with the optional chaining operator `?`. This ensures that if the `housingLocation` value is null or undefined the application doesn't crash.

- Update the body of the `DetailsComponent` class.
```ts
export class DetailsComponent {

  route: ActivatedRoute = inject(ActivatedRoute);
  housingService = inject(HousingService);
  housingLocation: HousingLocation | undefined;

  constructor() {
    const housingLocationId = Number(this.route.snapshot.params['id']);
    this.housingLocation = this.housingService.getHousingLocationById(housingLocationId);
  }

}
```

- Now the component has the code to display the correct information based on the selected housing location. The constructor now includes a call to the `HousingService` to pass the route parameter as an argument to the `getHousingLocationById` service function.

- modify styles in `src/app/details/details.component.css`.
