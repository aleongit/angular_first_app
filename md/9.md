### Conceptual preview of interfaces
- This tutorial introduces Angular services and dependency injection.

#### Angular services
- Angular services provide a way for you to separate Angular app data and functions that can be used by multiple components in your app. To be used by multiple components, a service must be made injectable. Services that are injectable and used by a component become dependencies of that component. The component depends on those services and can't function without them.

#### Dependency injection
- Dependency injection is the mechanism that manages the dependencies of an app's components and the services that other components can use.



### Step 1 - Create a new service for your app
```
ng generate service housing --skip-tests

CREATE src/app/housing.service.ts (136 bytes)
```

### Step 2 - Add static data to the new service
- **src/app/housing.service.ts**
```ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { HousingLocation } from './housinglocation';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class HousingService {
  readonly baseUrl = 'https://angular.io/assets/images/tutorials/faa';

  housingLocationList: HousingLocation[] = [
    {
      id: 0,
      name: 'Acme Fresh Start Housing',
      city: 'Chicago',
      state: 'IL',
      photo: `${this.baseUrl}/bernard-hermant-CLKGGwIBTaY-unsplash.jpg`,
      availableUnits: 4,
      wifi: true,
      laundry: true,
    },
    ...
  ];

  constructor() {}

  getAllHousingLocations(): HousingLocation[] {
    return this.housingLocationList;
  }

  getHousingLocationById(id: number): HousingLocation | undefined {
    return this.housingLocationList.find(
      (housingLocation) => housingLocation.id === id
    );
  }
}
```


### Step 3 - Inject the new service into HomeComponent
- At the top of `src/app/home/home.component.ts`, add the inject to the items imported from @angular/core. This will import the inject function into the `HomeComponent` class.
```ts
import { Component, inject } from '@angular/core';
```
- Add a new file level import for the `HousingService`
```ts
import { HousingService } from '../housing.service';
```
- From `HomeComponent`, delete the `housingLocationList` array entries and assign `housingLocationList` the value of empty array ([]). In a few steps you will update the code to pull the data from the `HousingService`.

- In `HomeComponent`, add the following code to inject the new service and initialize the data for the app. The constructor is the first function that runs when this component is created. The code in the constructor will assign the `housingLocationList` the value returned from the call to `getAllHousingLocations`.
```ts
...
housingLocationList: HousingLocation[] = [];
housingService: HousingService = inject(HousingService);

constructor() {
  this.housingLocationList = this.housingService.getAllHousingLocations();
}
...
```
