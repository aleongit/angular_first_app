## Lesson 10: Add routes to the application

- https://angular.io/tutorial/first-app/first-app-lesson-10

### Conceptual preview of routing

- This tutorial introduces routing in Angular. Routing is the ability to navigate from one component in the application to another. In Single Page Applications (SPA), only parts of the page are updated to represent the requested view for the user.
- The Angular Router enables users to declare routes and specify which component should be displayed on the screen if that route is requested by the application.
- In this lesson, you will enable routing in your application to navigate to the details page.

### Step 1 - Create a default details component

```
ng generate component details --standalone --inline-template --skip-tests

CREATE src/app/details/details.component.ts (315 bytes)
CREATE src/app/details/details.component.css (0 bytes)
```

### Step 2 - Add routing to the application

- In the `src/app` directory, create a file called `routes.ts`. This file is where we will define the routes in the application.
- In `main.ts`, make the following updates to enable routing in the application.

- Import the routes file and the `provideRouter` function.

```ts
import { provideRouter } from "@angular/router";
import routeConfig from "./app/routes";
```

- Update the call to `bootstrapApplication` to include the routing configuration:

```ts
bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
  providers: [provideProtractorTestingSupport(), provideRouter(routeConfig)],
}).catch((err) => console.error(err));
```

- In `src/app/app.component.ts`, update the component to use routing.
- Add a file level import for `RoutingModule`

```ts
import { RouterModule } from "@angular/router";
```

- Add `RouterModule` to the `@Component` metadata imports

```ts
imports: [
  HomeComponent,
  RouterModule,
],
```

- In the template property, replace the `<app-home></app-home>` tag with the `<router-outlet>` directive and add a link back to the home page.

```ts
template: `
  <main>
    <a [routerLink]="['/']">
      <header class="brand-name">
        <img class="brand-logo" src="/assets/logo.svg" alt="logo" aria-hidden="true">
      </header>
    </a>
    <section class="content">
      <router-outlet></router-outlet>
    </section>
  </main>
`,
```

### Step 3 - Add route to new component

- In `routes.ts`, perform the following updates to create a route
- Add a file level imports for the `HomeComponent`, `DetailsComponent` and the `Routes` type that you'll use in the route definitions.

```ts
import { Routes } from "@angular/router";
import { HomeComponent } from "./home/home.component";
import { DetailsComponent } from "./details/details.component";
```

- Define a variable called `routeConfig` of type `Routes` and define two routes for the app.

```ts
const routeConfig: Routes = [
  {
    path: "",
    component: HomeComponent,
    title: "Home page",
  },
  {
    path: "details/:id",
    component: DetailsComponent,
    title: "Home details",
  },
];

export default routeConfig;
```

- The entries in the `routeConfig` array represent the routes in the application. The first entry navigates to the `HomeComponent` whenever the url matches `''`. The second entry uses some special formatting that will be revisited in a future lesson.
