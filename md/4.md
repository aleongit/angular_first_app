## Lesson 4: Creating an interface
- https://angular.io/tutorial/first-app/first-app-lesson-04


### Conceptual preview of interfaces
- Angular uses TypeScript to take advantage of working in a strongly typed programming environment. Strong type checking reduces the likelihood of one element in your app sending incorrectly formatted data to another. Such type-mismatch errors are caught by the TypeScript compiler and many such errors can also be caught in your IDE.

In this lesson, you'll create an interface to define properties that represent data about a single housing location.


### Step 1 - Create a new Angular interface
```
ng generate interface housinglocation

CREATE src/app/housinglocation.ts (37 bytes)
```

### Step 2 - Add properties to the new interface
- This step adds the properties to the interface that your app needs to represent a housing location.


### Step 3 - Create a test house for your app
- You have an interface, but you aren't using it yet.
- In this step, you create an instance of the interface and assign some sample data to it. You won't see this sample data appear in your app yet. There are a few more lessons to complete before that happens.
