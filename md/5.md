## Lesson 5: Add an input parameter to the component
- https://angular.io/tutorial/first-app/first-app-lesson-05


### Conceptual preview of interfaces
- Angular uses TypeScript to take advantage of working in a strongly typed programming enInputs allow components to share data. The direction of the data sharing is from parent component to child component.
- In this lesson, you'll define `@Input()` properties in the `HousingLocationComponent` component which will enable you to customize the data displayed in the component.


### Step 1 - Import the Input decorator
- `src/app/housing-location/housing-location.component.ts`
```ts
import { Component, Input } from '@angular/core';
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';
import { HousingLocation } from '../housinglocation';
```

### Step 2 - Add the Input property
- `src/app/housing-location/housing-location.component.ts`
```ts
export class HousingLocationComponent {
  @Input() housingLocation!: HousingLocation;
}
```
- You have to add the ! because the input is expecting the value to be passed. In this case, there is no default value. In our example application case we know that the value will be passed in - this is by design. The exclamation point is called the non-null assertion operator and it tells the TypeScript compiler that the value of this property won't be null or undefined
