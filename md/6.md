## Lesson 6: Add a property binding to a componentâ€™s template
- https://angular.io/tutorial/first-app/first-app-lesson-06


### Conceptual preview of Inputs
- In this lesson, you'll continue the process of sharing data from the parent component to the child component by binding data to those properties in the template using property binding.
- Property binding enables you to connect a variable to an Input in an Angular template. The data is then dynamically bound to the Input.


### Step 1 - Update tag in the HomeComponent template
- This step adds property binding to the `<app-housing-location>` tag.
- **src/app/home/home.component.ts**
```ts
...
<app-housing-location [housingLocation]="housingLocation"></app-housing-location>
...
```
- When adding a property binding to a component tag, we use the `[attribute] = "value"` syntax to notify Angular that the assigned value should be treated as a property from the component class and not a string value.
- The value on the right handside is the name of the property from the `HomeComponent`.


### Step 2 - Confirm the code still works
