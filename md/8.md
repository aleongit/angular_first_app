## Lesson 8: Use *ngFor to list objects in component
- https://angular.io/tutorial/first-app/first-app-lesson-08


### Conceptual preview of interfaces
- In Angular, `ngFor` is a specific type of directive used to dynamically repeat data in a template. In plain JavaScript you would use a for loop - ngFor provides similar functionality for Angular templates.
- You can utilize `ngFor` to iterate over arrays and even asynchronous values. In this lesson, you'll add a new array of data to iterate over.


### Step 1 - Add housing data to the HomeComponent
- In this step, you will add an array of `HousingLocation` entries.
- Update the `HomeComponent` class to have a property called `housingLocationList`
- **src/app/home/home.component.ts**
```ts
export class HomeComponent {
  readonly baseUrl = 'https://angular.io/assets/images/tutorials/faa';

  housingLocationList: HousingLocation[] = [
    {
      id: 0,
      name: 'Acme Fresh Start Housing',
      city: 'Chicago',
      state: 'IL',
      photo: `${this.baseUrl}/bernard-hermant-CLKGGwIBTaY-unsplash.jpg`,
      availableUnits: 4,
      wifi: true,
      laundry: true
    },
    {
      id: 1,
      name: 'A113 Transitional Housing',
      city: 'Santa Monica',
      state: 'CA',
      photo: `${this.baseUrl}/brandon-griggs-wR11KBaB86U-unsplash.jpg`,
      availableUnits: 0,
      wifi: false,
      laundry: true
    },
   ...
  ];
}
```

### Step 2 - Update the HomeComponent template to use ngFor
- Update the `<app-housing-location>` tag in the template code
- **src/app/home/home.component.ts**
```ts
...
<app-housing-location
  *ngFor="let housingLocation of housingLocationList"
  [housingLocation]="housingLocation">
</app-housing-location>
...
```
- Note, in the code `[housingLocation] = "housingLocation"` the `housingLocation` value now refers to the variable used in the ngFor directive. Before this change, it refered to the property on the HomeComponent class.
